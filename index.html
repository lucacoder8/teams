<p>A hoist, also known as a winch, is a light and small lifting equipment that uses a drum to wrap steel wire rope or chain to lift or pull heavy objects. The winch can vertically lift, horizontally or obliquely pull heavy objects. There are three types of winches: manual winches, electric winches, and hydraulic winches. Mainly using electric winches. It can be used alone or as a component in machinery such as lifting, road construction, and mine hoisting. It is widely used due to its simple operation, large amount of rope winding, and convenient relocation. Mainly used for material lifting or flat towing in construction, water conservancy engineering, forestry, mining, docks, etc.</p>
<p>Large tonnage non-standard winch: mainly used for hoisting, pulling, unloading, pushing, and towing heavy objects. Installation and dismantling of various large and medium-sized concrete, steel structures, and mechanical equipment. Its structural characteristics are orderly arrangement of steel wire ropes, reliable hanging installation, suitable for road and bridge engineering such as docks, bridges, ports, and large-scale factory and mine installation equipment.</p>
<p>Pneumatic winch is a type of winch that uses compressed gas provided by an air compressor as its power source. Compared with traditional electric winches, pneumatic winches have the characteristics of explosion-proof, dustproof, and anti liquid splashing, and are more suitable for working in harsh environments. Therefore, pneumatic winches are widely used in industries such as ships, oil extraction, mining, and power.</p>
